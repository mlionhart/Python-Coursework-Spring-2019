## Acronym Creator

An acronym is a word formed by taking the first letters of the words in a phrase and making a word from them. For example, RAM is an acronym for “random access memory.” Write a program that allows the user to type in a phrase and then outputs the acronym for that phrase. Note: the acronym should be all uppercase, even if the words in the phrase are not capitalized.

Here's an example:

```Bruce teaches classes at Clark College```

The acronym would be:

```BTCACC```
