# Module 5 - Skill Building Exercise No. 1

## An Improved Date Converter

Program the [dateconvert2.py](https://github.com/belgort-clark/ctec-121-book-code-examples/blob/master/chapter05/dateconvert2.py) program from the textbook so that it can be improved to do the following:

- Use simultaneous assignment to get day, month, and year from user.
- Create the date1 string value using the .format() method to set it to the form dd/mm/yyyy
- Create the date2 string value using the .format() method to set it to the form "month day, year"
