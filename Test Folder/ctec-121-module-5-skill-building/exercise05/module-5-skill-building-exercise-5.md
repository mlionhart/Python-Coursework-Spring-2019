## The Value of Your Name

Numerologists claim to be able to determine a person’s character traits based on the “numeric value” of a name. The value of a name is determined by summing up the values of the letters of the name where “a” is 1, “b” is 2, “c” is 3 etc., up to “z” being 26. For example, the name “Zelle” would have the value 26 + 5 + 12 + 12 + 5 = 60 (which happens to be a very auspicious number, by the way).

Write a program that calculates the numeric value of a single name provided as input.

HINT: Use the **ord()** function (See [(https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord)](this page on the Python.org site).
