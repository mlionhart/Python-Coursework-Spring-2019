## Word Count

A common utility on **Unix/Linux** systems is a small program called **wc**. This program analyzes a file to determine the number of lines, words, and characters contained therein. Write your own version of wc. The program should accept a file name as input and then print three numbers showing the count of lines, words, and characters in the file.

Use this file to test your program: [sample_text.txt](sample_text.txt)

You should get the following results for your program:

Characters: 739
Words: 101
Lines: 2
