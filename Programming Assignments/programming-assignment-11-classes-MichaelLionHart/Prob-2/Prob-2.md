# Module 8 - Programming Assignment 11 Problem 2

## Create a Simple Student Class

Develop a class named **Student** that holds the following data about a student in instance variables:

- name 
- ID number
- major
- GPA

I leave it to you to determine which instance variables will be initialized with parameters in the constructor. Please explain your reasoning in comments in your code. Make sure that all the instance variables are initialized to some value.

The instance variables should be marked as private. Write getter and setter methods to access or update the instance variables.

Once you have written the class, write a test program that creates a list and stores four Student object elements. Makes sure your test program exercises all of the class methods. Use loops to display the state of the objects in the list.

Use the following data:

```text
Name            ID Number       Major           GPA
Joe Bella       9933            Web Development 3.8
Tucker Blank    3399            Nursing         3.0
Gayle Ujifusa   1011            Baking          2.8
Edna Anker      9875            Medical Office  3.0
```
