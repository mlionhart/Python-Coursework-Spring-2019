# Programming Assignment 6 - Problem 6

**Goal**
- Gain further experience with graphics objects

**Instructions**

Using the graphics library, develop a Python program to draw the a set of LEGO bricks. The desired output is shown below.

**Alternatives**
- One long program - just a sequence of draw commands. This will get you the basic points
- Instead of creating each object using a class from the library, clone a previously created object and use the move method to form the next brick. This is still long and tedious, but it shows use of "advanced" functionality. Some bonus points for this
- Use of functions. This will require you to think about what to use as parameters and to make layout calculations in your code. Bonus points for this solution. Done right, this will result in a short and elegant program.

**Bonuses**
- Using both cloning and functions will get you full bonuses.
- Using either cloning or functions, but not both, will get you partial bonus.
