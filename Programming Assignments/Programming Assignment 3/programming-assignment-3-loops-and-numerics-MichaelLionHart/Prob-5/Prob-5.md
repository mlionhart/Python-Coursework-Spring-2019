#  Module 2 - Programming Assignment 3 - Problem 5

**Goal:** 
- Have you put everytning together

**Assignment:**  
- There is no sample code. Refer back to code demos from class or previous problems.
- Use descriptive identifiers
- Comment you code. I suggest that you copy the problem description below to a comment block above your code so you have the specifications right in front of you while you code.
- Bonus points if you use variables with a value corresponding to the per item cost and then calculate a subtotal if more than one item is purchased.
- Bonus points for nicely formatted output.

**The Problem: Print a Receipt**
- You purchased the following:
    - 2 slices of pizza at $2.00 per slice
    - 1 large Coke at $1.50
    - 2 donuts at $0.56 each
- print the items purchased and their cost, one item per line
- print the total of all items
- print the sales tax (8.4% of the total)
- print the grand total
- ask the user to enter an amount
- print the amount tendered
- print the change due

Output that meets the requirements is shown below. Note: your's does not have to match exactly. This is some room for you to show your own preferences/design. At a minimum, the output would show the numbers in order. After that it is up to you.

```
Pizza @ 2:       4.0
Drink:           1.5
Donut @ 2:       1.12
----------------------
Subtotal:        6.62
Tax:             0.56

Total:           7.18
