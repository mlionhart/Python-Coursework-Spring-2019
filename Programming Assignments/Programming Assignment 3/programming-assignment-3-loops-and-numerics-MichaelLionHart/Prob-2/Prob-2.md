#  Module 2 - Programming Assignment 3 - Problem 2

**Goal:** 
- Demonstrate numeric types
- Demonstrate type conversion (casting)


**Assignment:**  
- The starter code has an example() function
- Fill in your code in the studentCode() function as instructed by the comments
- Notice the changes in the values as the type of the variables are converted.

The output should look like:

```
Example Output
x 5 is a <class 'int'>

x 5.0 is a <class 'float'>

Student Output
x 5 is a <class 'int'>
y 3.14 is a <class 'float'>
z a string is a <class 'str'>

y 3 is a <class 'int'>
y 9 is a <class 'int'>
z 12.34 is a <class 'float'>
