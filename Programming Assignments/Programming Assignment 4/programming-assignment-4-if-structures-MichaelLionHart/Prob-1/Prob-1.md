# Module 3 - Programming Assignment 4 - Problem 1

**Goals:**
- Demonstrate use of simple decision
- Demonstrate use of conditional code execution
- Demonstrate unit testing

**Problem Statement**
- Calculate the shipping cost and test the function

**Assignment**
- shippingCost() function
    - The starter code has the beginnings of a function that calculates the shipping cost. 
    - Add an if statement that sets the shipping cost to zero if the orderSubTotal is ***greater than or equal*** to 10.00
- unitTest() function
    - Think about what additional tests should be perfromed to fully test shippingCost(). HINT: How do you test greater than or equal to? (This is really two different conditions, i.e. two tests).
    - Add the additional test statements
